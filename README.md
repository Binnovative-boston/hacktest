# Physical Activity and Technology Hack Day

We are a group of students from the New York and Boston areas who were disappointed with the lack of international, open hackathons that focus on animals, so we started our own in 2023.

AnimalHack is a student-organized online hackathon for anyone who interacts with any animals – including pets, service animals, farm animals and wild animals.

AnimalHack offers a platform that inspires you to think of needs, wants and challenges in interacting with animals. It is intended to help you ignite creative solutions (hacks) with technology and innovate human-animal relationships.

AnimalHack welcomes anyone of all ages and all technical skills, from limited experience to advanced. 

Entry is free.
