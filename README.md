# Physical Activity and Technology Hack Day (PhysTech)

We are a group of students from the New York and Boston areas who are enthusiastic about physical activities. We started PhysTech in 2024 because there was no hackathon avaialble at that time for presenting our projects.

Physical activity is any body movement that works your muscles and requires more energy than resting. Walking, running, dancing, swimming, yoga, and gardening are a few examples of physical activity. -->

PhysTech is a student-organized online hackathon for anyone who does, watches or analyzes physical activities - including sports, fitness excercises and recreational practices. 

AnimalHack offers a platform that inspires you to think of needs, wants and challenges in interacting with animals. It is intended to help you ignite creative solutions (hacks) with technology and innovate human-animal relationships.

AnimalHack welcomes anyone of all ages and all technical skills, from limited experience to advanced. 

Entry is free.
